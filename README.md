# Encyclopedia for oculoplastic surgery and diagnosis

This is an open source encyclopedia-esque mobile application detailing different oculoplastic surgical procedures and diagnosis. The aim of this application is to provide a universal template for other medical procedures outside the field of oculoplastic. The application is built using a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) structure with an ASP.NET backend framework.
